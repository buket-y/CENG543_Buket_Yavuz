{"question": "Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin?", "gold_answer": "no", "retrieved_docs": [], "generated_answer": "Yes, peak concentration is important in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin. The peak concentration, which is the highest concentration of the drug in the bloodstream after a dose, is used to ensure that the patient is receiving an adequate dose of vancomycin to effectively treat the infection. Vancomycin is a time-dependent antibiotic, meaning that the concentration in the bloodstream must remain above a certain threshold for a certain period of time to achieve therapeutic effect. The peak concentration is one of the key parameters used to determine if the dosing regimen is achieving the desired therapeutic effect", "retriever": null, "generator": "Mistral-7B", "setting": "LLM-only", "id": "PMQA_997"}
{"question": "Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?", "gold_answer": "yes", "retrieved_docs": [], "generated_answer": "Yes, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel can enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars. PRP is a concentration of platelets and growth factors obtained from the patient's own blood. The application of PRP gel to the surgical site can promote hemostasis, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the production of new collagen and bone tissue. Several studies have reported that the use of PRP in third molar surgery leads to faster healing, reduced post-operative pain, and a lower risk of complications such as dry socket and infection.", "retriever": null, "generator": "Mistral-7B", "setting": "LLM-only", "id": "PMQA_998"}
{"question": "Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?", "gold_answer": "no", "retrieved_docs": [], "generated_answer": "There is no definitive answer to this question as the erosiveness of a medicine depends on various factors beyond just the presence or absence of sugars. Erosiveness refers to the ability of a substance to cause damage or wear away at a surface, such as tooth enamel. Factors that can influence the erosiveness of a medicine include its pH level, the frequency and duration of dosing, and the presence of other ingredients. Some studies suggest that acidic medicines, whether sugars-free or sugars-containing, may be more erosive to tooth enamel than neutral or", "retriever": null, "generator": "Mistral-7B", "setting": "LLM-only", "id": "PMQA_999"}
