The results have", "retriever": null, "generator": "Phi-3", "setting": "LLM-only", "id": "PMQA_998"}
{"question": "Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?", "gold_answer": "no", "retrieved_docs": [], "generated_answer": "No, sugars-free medicines are not inherently more erosive than sugars-containing medicines. The erosive potential of a medication depends on various factors, including its pH, formulation, and the presence of other erosive agents.\n\nSugars-containing medicines can sometimes contribute to dental erosion if they are acidic or contain other erosive substances. For example, some sugar-containing medicines may have a low pH, which can lead to the demineralization of tooth enamel.
